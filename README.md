# PyFlow

Codebase for the ~~Tensor Flow Equation~~ **PyFlow** library, used for computing local integrals of motion of a variety of disordered quantum systems and computing their non-equilibrium dynamics. The method is described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02906.

# How to run

The only file you need to edit is `main.py`. It takes three command line arguments, the first to specify the system size, the second the disorder potential, and the third the method used for computing the tensor contractions. For example:

```
python main.py 4 linear tensordot
```

will run the simulation for a system size `L=4` and a linear potential, using NumPy's `tensordot` method. To change other parameters (interaction strength, disorder strength, etc) you will need to edit the file `main.py`. All editable parameters are at the top of the file before the line `# Run Program` - in general, nothing below this line needs to be edited.

In general, `tensordot` is the best method to use for small systems if you don't require normal ordering or other advanced features. I find `vec` to be faster, particularly when running on a single thread, but as it's explicitly typed it can throw errors if you pass a dtype it's not expecting. For large systems and/or normal-ordering, use `jit`, but beware the compilation overhead on the first call to the contraction functions.

The other files are as follows:

* `flow_plots.ipnyb` : a Jupyter notebook for plotting the flow and testing convergence, for small systems only.
* `ED/ed.py` : the exact diagonalization script, calls QuSpin and returns result.
* `core/diag.py` : main body of the flow equation code, handles integration and computes RHS of differential equations.
* `core/contract.py` : tensor contraction routines, using several different methods ('einsum', 'tendordot', 'jit', 'vec').
* `core/init.py` : utility functions, e.g. generating Hamiltonian matrices/tensors and making directory to save data in.
* `core/utility.py` : various utility functions. **To do: move other helper fns from diag.py to here.**
* `tests/con_method_test.py` : test to check different contraction methods return same answer, to within numerical precision.
* `models/models.py` : contains model classes and initialisation functions. **To be cleaned up.**
* `examples/` : empty folder which will contain example scripts at a later date.

**GPU files have been added but are not yet fully tested.**

# Required Packages

* NumPy
* SciPy
* h5py
* [QuSpin](https://weinbe58.github.io/QuSpin/)
* Numba
* SymPy
* matplotlib
* os 
* sys

For the GPU implementation, the following additional packages (and their dependencies) are required:

* PyTorch

# To do 

* ~~Update non-equilibrium dynamics code to match syntax used for static functions.~~ (**Done, can be tidied up.**)
* Write more tests for non-interacting systems.
* ~~Normal-ordering for Hubbard models can introduce small deviations from Hermitian matrices. Why?~~ (**Fixed!**)
* For non-interacting systems, compute LIOMs with ED as a comparison/test? 
* Add creation/annihilation operators (factor of N cheaper than number operators to compute).
* ~~Add long-range couplings from earlier code versions.~~ **Done, to be tested thoroughly.**
* ~~Add 2D and 3D code.~~ **Done, passed tests in 2D.**
* Figure out better solution for filenames for various models.
* ~~Implement model classes?~~ **Done, to be tested thoroughly.**
* ~~Merge with spinful fermion (Hubbard model) code.~~ **Done, works for static properties.**
* Add bosons: comes down to changing a few minus signs in contract.py. **In progress.**
* Merge GPU code (via CuPy/PyTorch) into main.
* Benchmark against ED and tensor networks for finding ground state energy, non-equilibrium dynamics?
* Test code for normal ordering? **In progress, bugs fixed.**
* Add Floquet functionality? (Following https://www.scipost.org/SciPostPhys.11.2.028.)
* Possibility to study dissipative systems by using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians?
* Add Majorana functionality. (Done in different codebase...)
* Timing tests for einsum/tensordot/jit and MKL/BLAS?
* Add Cython as a method? Not good for GPUs, but useful for CPUs.
* Add old version of writing differential equations explicitly? Useful for systems not easily encoded as tensors.
* Add momentum space flow, for translationally invariant systems or systems deep in delocalized phase. (Added, commented out until tested.)
* Try to add spins? Their commutation relations are not friendly, but there must be some way to automate it.
* Open quantum systems: Lindblad operators possible by adapting spinful fermion code (2x2 block structure of L).
